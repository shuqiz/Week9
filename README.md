# Week9

I only deployed one honeypot, which is named mhn-honeypot-1. \

I have encountered several issues during the setup stage. First of all, I installed google cloud SDK on my local machine using git bash. But it turned out that the gcloud can not be initiated. Then I used google cloud shell and problem solved. The second issue I had was because the github repo was no longer available, I had to git cloned an alternative repo. The third issue I had was quite confusing, I did not have connection to my external IP address when I directly clicked it on my google cloud. But it was solved by manually type my honeypot external IP. Other things went fine except it kept me waiting for an hour to download the VM.
